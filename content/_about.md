Ever since I can remember, writing has always been a part of me. I’ve been a part of my high school and college publications. And naturally, I pursued writing in college, and got a degree to show for it. 

My previous jobs involved writing, editing, research, and consultancy.

Writing is my first love, and technology second. That’s why this blog was born -- combining the best of both worlds.  

In this blog, you’ll find articles on business, writing, and digital marketing. I hope you find gems and treasures here that will inspire you to pursue the life of your dreams.

Want to know more about me and the services I offer? Check out my portfolio: https://kateventures.tk/.

Formality aside, here are some fun facts about me: I love coffee, traveling, my Mac, and the beach! And if you are a coffee lover like me, send me a quick email at kat.udacity@gmail.com.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours truly,

Katrina "Katie" Coloso
