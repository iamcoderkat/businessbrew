"Everyone should know how to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think," ~ Steve Jobs

Technology has taken over the world and is so embedded in our day-to-day life that we barely even notice it. That is why it is no wonder that top companies are technology companies that have become household names such as Apple, Google, IBM, and Facebook. As such, breaking into tech was a critical and life-altering decision I made to stay relevant in this digital age.

A writer by profession, I decided to change career. And so this was how I became a student taking up a Diploma in Computer Science with my alma mater, UP. Saying that this took a huge leap of faith is quite an understatement.

Learning how to program is no easy feat. As I plunged into the deep sea of coding and programming, I have to learn how to swim and keep my head afloat figuratively. The pressure of both work and studies were pulling me down, yet I have to make it. So much to learn, yet so little time.

In my first semester in UP Open University, I have learned a lot. I learned about Javascript, HTML, CSS, JQuery, NodeJS, PhoneGap, and Cordova as well as how these work together to make a functioning and running mobile app. I also have begun to extensively use the terminal and text editor. I also learned to use Android Studio, run an emulator, and other Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

Upon learning about PhoneGap/Cordova in CMSC 202, I began to appreciate how it enables developers to make an app using web technologies namely HTML, CSS, and Javascript. To understand app development, I completed my Javascript and JQuery course in StackSkills.com. I also took a Phonegap course in Bitdegree.com and although some of the codes were deprecated or outdated, it taught me the basics. I also began taking a web developer course in Udemy.

Computer Science subjects pushed me to code and program more. The pressure and time constraints taught me to become resourceful and resilient. I sought tech community online through Github and Stack Overflow and other tech blogs, which became a valuable resource.

It also taught me to seek help especially when I could not make the app work. I am thankful to my professors for providing valuable help and support in completing the final project. It taught me that there is no harm in asking questions and clarifications.

As a whole, distance learning education has its share of advantages and disadvantages. Although it lacks the physical interaction in a traditional classroom, it proved to be a reliable way to acquire further education for working professionals like me. It is also a plus that UPOU has excellent instructors that offer support, and share their knowledge.

All in all, it showed me that anyone can learn how to code as long as you put your heart into it, and have the will and determination to learn and build your skills.
