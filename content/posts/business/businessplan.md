<h3>Identify your potential market </h3>
Determine who are your present or projected customers and how many are they?
Be specific as possible. Are you selling to bookstores? If you are selling this to the general public, you may group potential customers according to their age, gender, income and other demographic factors.
(i.e.) You know that your potential customers will likely be children aged 3-10 yrs. old, what does this tell you about your location? your advertising? Your prices?

<h3>Identify your competitors </h3>
Learn as much as you can about your competitors. 

<h3>Pricing </h3>
Set the price level that maximizes profit in the long run

<li>What are the product specifications like weight, dimensions, ingredients, brand name?</li>
<li>What is the use of it and why are you offering that to your buyers?</li>
