There are three (3) major business legal entities: sole proprietorship, partnership, and corporation.

<h2>SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP </h2>
Owned by 1 person registration is valid for one year and is renewable annually.
Most family businesses are single proprietorships.

<h2>PARTNERSHIP </h2>
Formed by 2 to 20 partners.
A partnership agreement can be written or oral.
Professionals commonly form partnerships and often are registered with government (i.e. engineers, doctors, accountants, etc.)

<h2>CORPORATION </h2>
Requires a charter/articles of incorporation formed at least by 5 organizers and has:
		-	Legal personality
		-	Continuous life
		-	Limited liability
		-	Capacity to raise capital

<h2>RAISING CAPITAL IN A CORPORATION </h2>

Stocks is a portion of ownership in a corporation. The holder of a stock is entitled to the companyâ€™s earnings and is responsible for its risk for the portion of the company that each stock represents.

<h3>Two Main Classes Of Stock </h3>

<h4>Preferred Stock</h4>

Stock in a publicly-traded company without voting rights, but otherwise with more rights than common stocks.
Preferred stockholders received dividends before common shares and sometimes have guaranteed dividends, while common shares only receive the leftovers.
They also have a prior claim on capital in the event of liquidation; all preferred stockholders must be paid off before a single common shareholder.

<h4>Common Stock</h4>

Stock in a publicly-traded company that entitles holders to vote at the annual meeting, to elect the Board of Directors, and to generally exercises control of the company.
They have the least precedence in the event of liquidation, that is, if the company goes bankrupt, common stockholders do not receive any money until all bondholders, other debtors, and preferred shareholders are paid in full.
